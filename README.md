# SoftSys Garbage Eaters

Our project goal is to create an LC-3 Virtual Machine and a small Garbage Collector to go with it.

- [ ] function headers
- [ ] TRAP functions (are we writing those in C or assembly?)
- [ ] other input handling functions?
- [ ] functions for terminal interfacing?
- [ ] functions for keyboard interfacing?

/* priority level, processor status register, privilege mode, privilege mode exception? */
/* QUESTION: do we need to implement operating system and supervisor stack: memory adresses x0200 through x2FFF */
/* QUESTION: is user stack the same as the available stack space for user programs, or something else we have to implement? */
