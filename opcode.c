* Opcode Functions
-----------------------------
* Naming conventions follow the conventions used by the descriptions of opcodes
* written by the creators of the LC-3 project found here: 
* http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0072467509/104652/LC3_unix.pdf
*
* Args:
*   uint16_t bits: binary number where the first digit indicates sign, the 
*     next four digits indicate opcode to execute, and the remaining digits 
*     represent other information used during execution
*
* Standardized variables (all uint16_t unless otherwise noted):
*   DR: destination register; where to store content
*   SR, SR1: source register 1; location of content
*   SR2: source register 2; location of content
*   BaseR: base register used to compute Base+offset addresses
*   imm5: 5-bit immediate value; bits [4:0] of an instruction
*   offset6: 6-bit value; bits [5:0] of an instruction
*   PCoffsetN: bits [N-1:0] of an instruction taken as an N-bit 2â€™s 
*     complement integer, sign-extended to 16 bits, and added to the 
*     incremented PC
