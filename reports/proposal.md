# Building a Virtual Machine
### By Gati A., Zoe M., and Caitlin C.

## Goals

Our goal is to build a virtual machine in C. Our VM will simulate a fictional computer called the LC-3. The LC-3 is popular for teaching university students how to program in assembly language. It has a simplified instruction set compared to x86, but contains all the main ideas used in modern CPUs.

Our *"definition of done"* is to have a completed and usable virtual machine that ZoÃ« and Caitlin will use to run malware on in future projects (is that fear in your eyes? I certainly hope so).

**Lower Bound:** Implement an MVP of a Virtual Machine that 

- Simulate basic LC-3 computer with CPU, Memory, Registers, Instruction Set, Condition Flags, etc.
- Run processes and execute programs
- Perform binary arithmetic
- Read and write to memory
- Interact with I/O devices
- Build a calculator to prove above points work

**Upper Bound:** Implement most functions of a Virtual Machine

- Emulate a more advanced Operating System
- Implement Garbage Collector
- Implement an HTML aspect or the ability to make visual a customization

## Team Goals

From this experience, we collectively aim to learn more about how virtual machines work and how garbage collectors work. We also hope to learn more about the possible vulnerabilities of virtual machines when analyzing malware and real-life applications of virtual machines, as in blockchain.

## Resources

For this project, we will need resources to learn more about virtual machines, garbage collectors, and how to implement both. We have found some explanatory resources and tutorials of varying complexity and depth; we will use a combination of tutorials and will cite our sources accordingly. Currently we have a list of sources on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Building-A-Virtual-Machine-6cca4d552bc54c99ad363216cb1f9462).

## Tasks

Our first step is reading the resources we have looked at and to take notes on key concepts. There are four websites we think that would be great starting points for our project. 

- Gati will look at one implementation of a virtual machine.
- Zoe will look at an implementation of a garbage collector in C.
- Caitlin will look at another implementation of a virtual machine with an included garbage collector.
