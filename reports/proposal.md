# Building a Virtual Machine
### By Gati A., Zoe M., and Caitlin C.

Our goal is to design and build a virtual machine in C. It should function as a normal virtual machine, e.g. run processes, emulate an basic Operating System, etc. Our lower bound is to implement an MVP of a Virtual Machine. A stretch goal of ours is to implement a Virtual Machine with a Garbage Collector. 

- What is the goal of your project; for example, what do you plan to make, and what should it do?  Identify a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.
- What are your learning goals; that is, what do you intend to achieve by working on this project?
- What do you need to get started?  Have you found the resources you need, do you have a plan to find them, or do you need help?
- What are your first steps?  Describe at least three concrete tasks that you can do immediately, and identify which member of the team will do them.  
- what is the "definition of done"; that is, what will you produce to demonstrate that the task is done?

6) Complete your proposal, view it on GitHub, and copy the GitHub URL.  Then paste the URL in the submission space below.  You only need one proposal for each team, but everyone should submit it.
